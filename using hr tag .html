        <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics developed
            by Guido van Rossum. It was originally released in 1991. Designed to be easy as well as fun, the name
            "Python" is a nod to the British comedy group Monty Python.</p>
