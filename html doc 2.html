    <h1>Nature</h1>
    <p><font face="Helvetica" size="6"> Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.</font> <br> <mark>Although humans are part of nature,</mark> human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena</p><hr>
