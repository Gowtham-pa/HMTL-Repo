    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br>[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .<br>css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
